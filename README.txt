This is a collection of various python projects that I'm working on

Current Projects :

1. PythonWeatherReport.py is just a simple weather report script, it gets weather of a specified city and will send an email out from a specified account (I created a throwaway account for this, security reasons) and will send me an email to my main email with a daily weather report.
