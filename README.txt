This is a collection of various python projects that I'm working on

Current Projects :

1. PythonWeatherReport.py 
  Weather report script, it gets weather of a specified city and will send an email out from a specified account (I created a throwaway account for this, security reasons) and will send me an email to my main email with a daily weather report

2. PythonNetworkTest.py
  This is just a basic network troubleshooting script for a local computer. Pings loopback -> 3 public facing IPs from 3 popular DNS providers -> pings DNS domain names to test DNS resolution -> conducts tracert on 3 public facing IPs
