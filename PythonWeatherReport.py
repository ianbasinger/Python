# This python script will run off of a city, give local weather information, and sends an email from my burner gmail account to my primary gmail 
# Burner account is for security reasons, and has a different password etc. from my main accounts. I don't want this program to have access to my primary gmail or information
# It will just send the email from my burner account to my main gmail account
# This can be automated using Windows Task Scheduler and set a specific time and condition to run the script, create batch file for the scheduler to run
